"""Backends for rendering various file types.

Backends are used to render complex file formats that require
special processing to display. They normally run in a background
thread that communicates with the UI thread via a queue.

The base class for backends is backends.shared.Backend.

All backend constructors require the path to an input file as
their first positional argument. Backend constructors may optionally
accept additional keyword arguments; keywords not recognized by a
particular backend are silently ignored.

A minimal backend implements two functions:

  page_count()
    Return the number of pages in the input file.

  render_page(page_num)
    Render the specified page of the input file.
    Supported return types are:
      PIL Image object
      Tkinter PhotoImage object
      Raw image data understood by PhotoImage

These are internal APIs and subject to change at any time.
