tkDocViewer is a document viewer widget for Python + Tkinter.
It is primarily intended for displaying file previews.

Currently supported file types include:
  * Plain text
  * PDF, Postscript (requires an external Ghostscript binary)
  * PNG, GIF, JPEG (requires PIL)

tkDocViewer is designed to be simple above all else. All dependencies
outside the Python standard library are optional (though file type
support will be limited). Its API is designed to let you accomplish
tasks with as few method calls as possible.

This emphasis on simplicity does come with some performance costs.
It is not necessarily the fastest nor the most resource-efficient
viewer, but it should generally run well enough to get the job done.

Both Python 2 and 3 are supported, on Windows and Unix platforms.


Usage
-----

tkDocViewer consists of a single module, tkdocviewer (note the module
name is lowercase), which exports a single class, DocViewer.

A brief example program:

    # This assumes Python 3
    from tkinter import *
    from tkdocviewer import *

    # Create a root window
    root = Tk()

    # Create a DocViewer widget
    v = DocViewer(root)
    v.pack(side="top", expand=1, fill="both")

    # Display this README file
    v.display_file("README")

    # Start Tk's event loop
    root.mainloop()

For more documentation, try "python -m pydoc tkdocviewer".


Dependencies
------------

Most file formats require third-party modules or external applications.
tkDocViewer will still run without them, but file format support will be
limited by what's available on your system.

  * Ghostscript (https://ghostscript.com/)
    External application
    Required for PDF and Postscript support.

  * Pillow (https://python-pillow.org/)
    Python module
    Required for most image formats; optional for PDF support.
